		<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	</header>
	<article>
		<p><b>Time complexity</b> refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. It quantifies how the execution time increases with larger inputs. An algorithm with lower time complexity generally executes faster and is more efficient, making it preferable for large-scale problems and real-time applications.</p>
		
		<p><b>Space Complexity</b>, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. It addresses how much memory is consumed by the algorithm during its execution.Complexities are measure in the usnits O(n).</p>
